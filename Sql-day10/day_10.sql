--Practice questions

--1. Categorise patients as 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low' satisfaction based on their scores.
SELECT 
    patient_id,
    name,
    satisfaction,
    CASE
        WHEN satisfaction >= 80 THEN 'High'
        WHEN satisfaction >= 50 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END AS satisfaction_level
FROM patients;

--2. Label staff roles as 'Medical' or 'Support' based on role type.
SELECT 
    staff_id,
    staff_name,
    role,
    CASE
        WHEN role IN ('doctor', 'nurse') THEN 'Medical'
        ELSE 'Support'
    END AS role_category
FROM staff;

--3.Create age groups for patients (0-18, 19-40, 41-65, 65+)
SELECT 
    patient_id,
    name,
    age,
    CASE
        WHEN age BETWEEN 0 AND 18 THEN '0-18'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 19 AND 40 THEN '19-40'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 41 AND 65 THEN '41-65'
        ELSE '65+'
    END AS age_group
FROM patients;



--Challenge questions

--Create a service performance report showing service name, total patients admitted, and a 
--performance category based on the following: 'Excellent' if avg satisfaction >= 85, 'Good' if >= 75, 
--'Fair' if >= 65, otherwise 'Needs Improvement'. Order by average satisfaction descending.
SELECT 
    service,
	SUM(patients_admitted) AS total_admitted,
	ROUND(AVG(patient_satisfaction), 2) AS avg_satisfaction,
	CASE
        WHEN AVG(patient_satisfaction) >= 85 THEN 'Excellent'
        WHEN AVG(patient_satisfaction) >= 75 THEN 'Good'
        WHEN AVG(patient_satisfaction) >= 65 THEN 'Fair'
        ELSE 'Needs Improvement'
	 END AS performance_category
FROM services_weekly
GROUP BY service
ORDER BY AVG(patient_satisfaction) DESC;
